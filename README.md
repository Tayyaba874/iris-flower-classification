# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their petal and sepal measurements.

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset.
- Source: [Kaggle - Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning)

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. Import libraries
2. Load and explore the dataset
3. Visualize the data using pairplots
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Train a Random Forest Classifier
6. Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report

## 📈 Output

- The trained model successfully classifies the flower species with high accuracy.
- Accuracy score and classification report are shown at the end of the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `iris.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells one by one.
